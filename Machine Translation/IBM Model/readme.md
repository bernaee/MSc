### IBM Models 1, 2, and 3
- I use the parallel corpus between Turkish and English.
- The corpus is divided into a training part (about 90% of the corpus) and a test part (about 10%).
- Using the training data, I implement the IBM Model 1, the IBM model 2 and the IBM Model 3 on the parallel corpus.
- IBM Model 1 uses lexical translation probabilities.
- IBM Model 2 uses alignment probabilities.
- IBM Model 3 consider null insertion and fertility probabilities.
