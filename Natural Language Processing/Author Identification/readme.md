### Author Identification
- The author identification system is implemented by using both a generative model (Naïve Bayes) and a discriminative model (Support Vector Machine).
- The "69 Authors” corpus is used. The corpus includes 910 articles from 69 different Turkish authors.
- SVM multiclass library which is available at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light/svm_multiclass.html is used to train a SVM model.
